Obstacles (Pre-Sale)

Lack of Time: Prospects may feel they don’t have enough time to consider a new product or service.
Handling Strategy: Acknowledge their time constraints and offer to provide information in a concise manner. Suggest a follow-up at a more convenient time.

Budget Constraints: Prospects might believe they cannot afford the product or service.
Handling Strategy: Discuss the value and return on investment (ROI) of the product. Offer flexible payment options or demonstrate how the product can save them money in the long run.

Uncertainty About Fit: Prospects may doubt whether the product or service is suitable for their needs.
Handling Strategy: Ask probing questions to understand their specific needs and tailor your pitch accordingly. Provide case studies or testimonials from similar clients.

Fear of Change: Prospects may be hesitant to change from their current solution or routine.
Handling Strategy: Highlight the benefits of the new solution and provide reassurance through support and training. Share success stories of others who made the transition.

Objections (Post-Sale)
Objections arise after a prospect has been presented with a solution but is hesitant to commit. Common objections include:

Price Objections: Prospects may feel the price is too high.
Handling Strategy: Reiterate the value and benefits of the product. Break down the cost in terms of long-term savings or benefits. Offer a comparison with competitors if applicable.

Concerns About Efficacy: Prospects may doubt whether the product will deliver the promised results.
Handling Strategy: Share testimonials, case studies, or data that demonstrate the product’s effectiveness. Offer a trial period or guarantee to alleviate concerns.

Timing Issues: Prospects may feel that it's not the right time to make a purchase.

Understanding the decision-making process helps salespeople connect with buyers and influence their choices positively.
Identify customer profile, his personlity and persona to increase loyalty and boost conversion rates.
You can change your tonality and personality based on the person (humor, formal…).
Your work helps salespeople tailor their messaging and approach for different customer types.
Personalization shows that you value them as individuals rather than just a sale.

Types of ecommerce customers:
1. Browsers and window shoppers
Browsers are interested in what your online store offers, but they aren't necessarily ready to buy now. 
They may visit multiple product pages or add several products to their carts, but they're unlikely to visit 
your checkout page because they don't intend to make an online purchase.
## The strategy: Target these customers with pop-up windows offering discounts or other incentives.
Limited-time promotions are a particularly effective option or invite further engagement through 
newsletter signup invitations, and email submission forms to nurture those leads in the future.

2. Discount seekers
They tend to value price (and percentage off of regular price) over loyalty to a particular ecommerce 
store, and they are highly responsive to sales and promotional offers.
## The strategy: You can target bargain hunters with incentives like flash sales, free shipping, or 
reduced shipping costs, coupons, and loyalty rewards to retain their interest.

3. Impulsive buyers
They may not be looking for the products your ecommerce business sells, but they'll purchase 
online if a product fulfills a real-time emotional need.
## The strategy: This type of buyer is often responsive to product recommendations, so you can 
increase sales with personalized product suggestions, upselling, and cross-selling techniques.
Use urgency tactics like countdown timers and emphasize easy checkouts.

4. Researchers
They browse multiple ecommerce stores, comparing the price point, customer care, quality, and functionality of comparable products
## The strategy: To win mission-driven online shoppers, show how your product or service is superior to the 
alternatives. Include detailed product information and customer reviews on your ecommerce site, FAQs, and comparison tools.

5. Brand loyalists
They feel allegiance to your ecommerce business and are looking for a reason to continue choosing your company over others.
## The strategy: You can use exclusive discounts, loyalty or rewards programs, recognition by email and early access to new products.
Incorporate personalized outreach to show your appreciation.

6. The Window Shopper
Behavior: Browses extensively but rarely makes a purchase.
Key Traits: Interested in exploring but hesitant to commit.
How to Engage: Use retargeting, wish-list reminders, and enticing follow-up emails.
