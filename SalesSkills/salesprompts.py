sales_intent = """
In real scenarios, user intents or preferences are gradually revealed during the course of conversations. 

 detect any potential intent which may be explicitly or implicitly expressed 
 by the user and steer the conversation towards topics related to the identified intent, 
 considering that the user may not have a specific intent in mind at the beginning or middle of the conversation.

find a topic that intersects between the current topic and the identified intent before transitioning the 
dialogue to the target intent to avoid abrupt changes in topics. 

Dialogue History:
{dialogue_history}

Here is a list of potential intents that might be referred by the user:
{intents}

Think carefully to determine the potential intent and provide suitable response given the above dialog history.

Output Format:
Thought: <thought>
Four types of thoughts:
 • The user did not implicitly mention any potential intent, I should continue the chit-chat. 
 • The user implicitly mentioned the intent of {intent}. I should smoothly pivot the conversation to the topic of {intent}. 
 • The user did not change the topic of {intent}. I should continue the topic. 
 • The user has explicitly shown his/her intent of {intent}. 
Response: <response>

LLMs actively identify any utterances (responses or comments within the dialogue) that seem inconsistent 
with the flow or context. Once these inconsistencies are spotted, the LLMs also provide explanations for 
why each utterance was flagged. This feedback is then used to revise and enhance the overall dialogue structure,
making it more consistent, relevant, and natural-sounding.
